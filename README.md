# PS2-EX5: Titanic Survival Prediction Analysis

This project is an analysis of the Titanic dataset, focused on identifying key features for predicting passenger survival. Using various visualizations, we examine relationships between features such as passenger class, gender, age, fare, and embarkation point, aiming to support feature selection for building a predictive model.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **`report.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and visualizations, along with explanations of how each feature relates to survival.
- **`figures/`**: A directory containing all generated visualizations used in the report, saved as `.png` files.
- **`data/`**: The dataset files (not included in the repository if they are too large or sensitive). Ensure that the Titanic dataset (`train.csv` and optionally `test.csv`) is placed here.

## Getting Started

To run the analysis locally, youâ€™ll need Python and a few libraries installed. Follow the instructions below to set up the environment and run the code.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

You can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
